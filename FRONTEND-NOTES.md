Notes: 
I have used Redux to show my skills in that matter, even though such a simple app wouldn't really need it

The user can double click on an asset on the left panel to add it to the preview on the right.
I have as well implemented a drag and drop functionality as this is something I haven't done in the past, so it was as well a good learning for me

With more time and for a real life application, I would refactor the code further and write more tests
